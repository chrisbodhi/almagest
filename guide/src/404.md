## 404: Celestial Body Not Found

It appears you've strayed from your intended orbit. The page you're seeking has either:

- **Escaped velocity** — exceeded the gravitational pull of this documentation
- **Decayed from orbit** — been removed or relocated
- **Never achieved orbital insertion** — may not have existed in the first place

## Return to Known Coordinates

Perhaps you'll find what you seek at these stable Lagrange points:

- [Introduction](./introduction.md) — Return to the observatory
- [Summary](./SUMMARY.md) — Navigate the constellation of chapters
- [History](./chapter_1/history.md) — Trace the paths of those who came before

## Course Correction

If you believe this page *should* exist, consider filing an issue. Even Ptolemy had to revise his epicycles.
