# Calculations

When completing calculations using radians, note that radians are actually dimensionless; they are a ratio of the arc length to the radius. Thus, they can be disregarded when ensuring that your units match.

As an example, when calculating the tether tip speed by multiplying the angular velocity by the radius of the skyhook (tether length extending from the rotating center station):


\\[ v_{tip} = ω × r \\]


We know that the tip speed must be in meters (or kilometers) per second, and the radius in meters (or kilometers). The angular velocity ω is given in radians per second, rad/s. We see that the radians are ignored in this calculation in order to get the desired meters (or kilometers) per second.
