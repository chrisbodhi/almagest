# An introduction

!["The observatory of Alexandria with an astronomer measuring the heavens with some instruments (cross staff, mariner's astrolabe) which actually belong to a much later period (source: Camille Flammarion, Astronomie Populaire: Description générale du ciel, Paris: 1880)."](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/astro/images/alexandria_observatory_sm.jpg)

>I know that I am mortal by nature, and ephemeral; but when I trace at my pleasure the windings to and fro of the heavenly bodies I no longer touch the earth with my feet: I stand in the presence of Zeus himself and take my fill of ambrosia.

&mdash; Ptolemy, _Ptolemy's Almagest_

What you have before you is a guide. It is not intended to be the answer to every question you have, but to show you how you may answer those questions. It is here to lay the groundwork and to ensure that you and your fellow travellers have access to the same vantage point for our shared explorations. After all, astronomy is rooted in having a perspective.

## How to use this guide

Despite its packaging, this guide is not just for the Rust crate called `almagest`, nor its usage and application in the WebAssembly (`almagest-wasm`) or `modeling` crates. Yes, this guide does explain those crates. It also covers the physics that these crates codifies. By time you finish reading this guide, you'll be well-versed in the subjects of orbital mechanics, the physics of rotation, and a subset of material science.
